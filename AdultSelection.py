# --- Function:  
#     All previous adults die, but m (the maximum size of the
#     adult pool) is smaller than n (the number of children).
#     Hence, the children must compete among themselves for the 
#     m adult spots, so selection pressure is signiÔ¨Åcant.

# --- Function:  
#     The m adults from the previous generation do not die, so

#     on juveniles is extremely high, since they are competing
#     with some of the best individuals that have evolved so far.
